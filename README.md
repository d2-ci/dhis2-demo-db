### DHIS 2 demo databases

This repository contains PostgreSQL dumps of demo databases.

To work with the database you can gunzip it:

	gunzip dhis2-db-sierra-leone.sql.gz
	
Restore it using psql:

	psql -d "dev" -U dhis -f dhis2-db-sierra-leone.sql

After modifying it you can create a dump using pg_dump. Please gzip and exclude the analytics and resource tables as they will be generated later and take up a lot of space:

	pg_dump "dev" -U dhis -T "analytics*" -T "_*" | gzip > dhis2-db-sierra-leone.sql.gz

Follow the naming convention for directories under the sierra-leone directory, which is the DHIS 2 version number (e.g. "2.28") and "dev" (snapshot).

Remember to write good commit messages to explain what you do with the databases.
